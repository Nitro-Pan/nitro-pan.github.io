Hi! I'm Tate, a software engineer and game developer located in Vancouver, BC.

If I'm not at my computer, you can usually find me bouldering, playing Magic, or playing board games. I'm currently deep into my local Magic tournament scene, so you can probably find me at any big events in the lower mainland. Come say hi!

I enjoy making scalable and abstract solutions for any system I'm working on. A lot of my time spent developing UI for MCoC was just thinking about how I could make this system as pluggable as possible, and let the other engineers use my UI components to speed up their workflows.

Be sure to check out my blog posts for more live updates! I'll update their structure every once in a while when I find things that I don't like about them, and they hold a glimpse into how my thoughts work for anything I'm posting about.

All the images on this site that aren't credited were taken by me. I shoot on a Nikon F4, typically with a Nikkor 50mm 1.8 AF-D lens. It's cheap, the shots are clear, and it fits nicely in my camera bag.
